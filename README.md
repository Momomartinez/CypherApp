# cypherapp


For Airbnb (Please view UnicodeViewController.swift file for the part of the code I am the most proud of, I had a hard time getting the encrypt and decrypt part of this code to work and used enumerated() to get it to work and although I am sure there may be an easier way to do it, I was very proud to have been able to figure it out on my own with little programming experience to get it working. Still a couple bugs that I am working on, but I was able to get to NOT crash. )
